                    <h2>
                        East Africa School of Astronomy (EA-SA) 
                    </h2>
                </p><br>
                
                <p>
                    <br>
                    In the past, there had been a number of trainings and workshops of astronomy conducted in the region  in different format for several years with individuals as well as institutional efforts in the region . However, there was no school or training center formed so far that continuously provide this training in a well coordinated and sustainable manner. It was also difficult to monitor and measure the impact it has created in the region. It ,is therefore, needs a mechanism to create regional platform and regional node of coordination, to develop long-term collaborations at regional and international level by launching regional Astronomical School.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, the  main idea of the project is to strengthen the east Africa region astronomical community partnership via science diplomacy and  deliver short-term training that focus on improving skills and competitiveness of early career BSc and MSc graduates and students in astronomy and science related fields with well organized regional platform called East Africa School of Astronomy  (EA-SA).
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    East Africa School of astronomy program contains training of how to use and practice Astronomical instruments; apply Astronomical softwareâ€™s, big data analysis that can be applied to multi sector fields at governmental and industry level that fits to the modern technology and global market demand.  It also incorporates science communication skills to enhance the training interpersonal relation as well as science communications skills.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The school will be organized and coordinated by East Africa regional office of Astronomy for Development (EA-ROAD) in partnership with East Africa Astronomical Society (EAAS). The school is planned to be conducted biennially and it is linked with the general Assembly (GA) of East Africa Astronomical Society (EAAS).  It is planned to be conducted for one week prior to the EAAS general Assembly. The target audience of the project is early carrier BSC graduates and MSc students from Astronomy and Science background. It is expected that at least 25 students will participated in the School every year. The School Course will be delivered by partnering organizations from South Africa Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), Ethiopian Space Science and Technology Institute (ESSTI) and others.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The East Africa Astronomy School is open for all participants from the region. The school will consider equal participation of women and people with disability. It will consider half of the trainee to be female and hence it promotes empowerment of women and inclusiveness. Priority should also be given for participants who are underprivileged and coming from a country where astronomy is not well established.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The East Africa School of Astronomy (EASA) will act as platform that used to engage Astronomical Institutions, Professional Society, science educators and advocators, governmental and nongovernmental agencies to support the project and realize the EASA training in continuous manner.
